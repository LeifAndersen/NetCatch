Netcatch is a codeword for a podcatcher I've been working on for a few weeks now, it is written for Android and I'm mainly using a Droid X as my testing unit.

Thank you for checking out this project.  It's still very much pre-alpha software, as in it's not functional yet, but I would appreciate any help you are willing to give.

Currently this software can:
* Subscribe to feeds
* Download content from that feed, and parse the XML
* Display the information in a list (although the pictures won't show up).
* Show you a queue of episodes.
* Have a Pseudo mediaplayer gui that's no where's near completion.

Some of the things planned before the first market release (although this may change).
* Finished up the gui
* Actually play the episode, or let the user choose another mediaplayer they have on their phone.
* Google Listen Integration
* A directory of good podcasts
* Easier subscribing
* Actually listening to when the user goes to feed, and catch that broadcast.
* Be awesome
